The script was made to automate the repackaging of a file into Oxi Joiner. For personal use, you need to edit the script. For example, the exact position of the pixels of an object on the screen. All other information is in README.md.

Unpack the archive before use (password: 12345678). Attention, your antivirus can damage it with suspicion of a virus. Edit the script. After that, run the program and only then run the script. Use dev.py for determining the position of the cursor. You can use starter.bat for main.py and dev.bat for dev.py.
Have a good use.
